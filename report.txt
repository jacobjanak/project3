1. Hours to complete the project: 3 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Ring Buffer):
   This problem was definitely tricky to get started on. It was hard to know
   what format to use for the ring buffer because the instructions didn't give
   us an obvious diagram of what the list would look like and what the elements
   would represent. As I progressed through these two problems, I gradually
   got a better understanding of what rb[0] through rb[3] were for. I ended up
   passing the test for problem 1 before I actually got it right, since the
   test just looks at the size function and doesn't *really* test enqueue or
   dequeue. My mistake was that I didn't treat the buffer as a cyclical list,
   I just kept the first element at rb[0][0]. Because of that, I didn't
   understand the need for rb[2] or rb[3]. I still don't understand the need
   for rb[1] since it's pretty easy to calculate the size of the buffer by
   counting the values in rb[0] that are not None. I know it's more expensive
   to do it that way, but the size seems to not be particlurly useful in this
   program. After I got about halfway through problem 2, I realized that I
   needed to make my buffer in problem 1 cyclical. The only tricky part of that
   for me was the fact that rb[1] through rb[3] are supposed to be 'None' when
   the buffer is empty. It was a little tough writing all the extra code
   to make that happen. I'm sure some of the code I wrote is unnecessary, but I
   wanted to make sure you could empty the buffer and re-fill it if you needed
   to. I feel like the default values of rb[1] to rb[3] should be zero, not
   None. It would make the calculations a lot easier.

   Problem 2 (Guitar String):
   I cruised through this one pretty easily. The toughest/most annoying part
   was the fact that some of the values in the ring buffer are supposed to be
   defaulted to None. I would prefer if the default value for 'size', 'first',
   and 'last' were zero because that would make my job easier. I found the best
   way to get around this is to just initialize them to zero in my create() and
   create_from_samples() functions (in the latter, the size would be the length
   of the sample list). I feel like I'm doing something wrong there because
   the instructions don't mention anything about initializing the values like
   this but it makes sense to me and it works. Also, I'm not sure if my code
   for white noise is 100% correct: string[0][i] = math.random() - 0.5
   The problem with it is the value would never be exactly 0.500000. I feel
   like it's fine for the purpose of this project. Other than that, I don't
   really have much to write about for this one. The code was easy, but
   understanding the writeup was a little tricky. Once I understood it, I didn't
   have issues implimenting it.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I enjoyed this project. Like the other projects, I feel like the challenge
   is reading and understanding the writeup/checklist, and the easy part is the
   code.
